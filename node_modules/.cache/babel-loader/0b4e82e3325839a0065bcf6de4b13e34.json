convertible note, however, depending on the campaign type, you can also invest in debt or SAFEs.</li>\r\n                <li>Debt is, in essence, a loan. You, as the investor, buy promissory notes and take on the role of lender. The corporation must then repay your loan with interest within a defined time frame</li>\r\n                <li>Convertible notes are debt instruments that can be converted into stock. You purchase debt from the company and receive interest on it until the loan reaches its maturity date when it either converts to equity or is paid back to you in cash.</li>\r\n                <li>Convertible notes are a type of SAFE. Because SAFEs have no provisions for a cash payout, you, as an investor, are reliant on the SAFE converting to equity at some point in the future, which may or may not happen depending on whether the firm is acquitted or goes public. SAFE was created to be the financial tool you need without the headaches of general meetings or completing unneeded paperwork. It has precise information rights and easier exits, and it appreciates in value in the same way as stock shares do. If the startup is liquidated, a SAFE holder has priority over ordinary shareholders in terms of repayment.</li>           \r\n            </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"col-md-12\">\r\n            <h3>What exactly is M-SAFE?</h3>\r\n            <p>MXi's straightforward equity arrangement. An M-SAFE is a partnership agreement between investors and companies seeking funding. Individuals make investments with the hopes of earning a profit, whether in the form of company equity or cash distribution. The M-SAFE is an adapted version of the SAFE, a financial instrument invented by Y Combinator and widely utilized by angels and venture capitalists investing in startups all around the world. It's meant to function for investment campaigns with hundreds or even thousands of participants, and it's employed in various forms by several industry heavyweights.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"col-md-12\">\r\n            <h3>What is the mechanism behind it?</h3>\r\n            <p>Investors that use the M-SAFE receive a financial stake in the company but do not become equity holders right once. At the time of issue, it takes the legal form of Compulsorily Convertible Debentures ('CCDs'). When 'activation events,' such as an acquisition or an IPO, occur, these CCDs are converted into stock.</p>\r\n            <p>Risk Note: Activation events are not guaranteed.

SAFE's Investors put their money in at a very early stage, so their share is only affected by future occurrences.</p>\r\n            <p>Risk Note: If an activation event does not happen, you may never get a return on your investment.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"col-md-12\">\r\n            <h3>Terms of the M-SAFE</h3>\r\n            <p>Overview On trigger events such as a 100 percent secondary sale of CCDs, a buyback, or an IPO, this agreement issues compulsorily convertible debentures that convert into securities issued in future fundraising, such as equity shares or compulsorily convertible preference shares.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"col-md-12\">\r\n            <ul>\r\n            <li><b>Instrument</b>- Compulsorily Convertible Debentures (CCDs)</li>\r\n            <p><b>Conversion Events</b>- 100% secondary sale, Buyback, Acquisition, IPO</p>\r\n            <p><b>Cap Table</b></p>\r\n            <p><b>1.

Typically, startups just have to negotiate one item: the valuation cap or discount cap.</p>\r\n            <p><b>2.\tSafety First:</b> First and foremost, M-SAFE holders have priority over ordinary shareholders when it comes to repayment. A T-SAFE holder is paid before any other stakeholder if the startup is liquidated.</p>\r\n            <p><b>3.\tCheaper: </b> The legal costs are a bare minimum.</p>\r\n            <p><b>4.\tBenefits of Equity without any hassles:</b> M-SAFE is a financial instrument that eliminates the inconveniences of attending general meetings and signing superfluous paperwork.
